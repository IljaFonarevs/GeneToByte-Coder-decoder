A simple converter of a string containing a genes representation, it was created in order to get familiar with bitwise operators and logic.

Pros:
    Speed: bitwise representation of String allows the faster coding and decoding process
    Simplicity: Concept itself is an easy-to-learn and fairly easy-to-implement in other projects, although if another programmer is not familliar with bitwise operators many things may seem confusing

Cons:
    Bad readability: Some of the variable names is not representative enough of its functions, comments are needed. Loop conditions may need a variables in order to express the reason for particular condition.

Ways-to-Improve:
    Sophisticated alghoritms: Use of some of the more advanced and efficient data structures or alghoritms may improve speed of coding\decoding at the cost of simplicity
    Comments: Add comments to explain and point out this project logic and crucial points

Conclusion:
    The project has reached its initial task by providing an opportunity for me to learn more about bitwise operators and logic, some of the more advanced concepts will require addition learning, but the foundation has been laid.
One of the major point I notecied is readability, I should pay more attention to it.
